# Hi, I’m ZtotheZ

I build practical security tooling focused on SOC workflows, detection engineering, and endpoint visibility.

My work explores how telemetry is generated, collected, enriched, and transformed into actionable signals.

## Selected Work

### SIEM & Monitoring

**Security-Monitoring-SIEM-Setup**
Endpoint log collection and event analysis using Sysmon, Winlogbeat, and Filebeat.

**Building-a-Cloud-Based-SIEM-with-Elastic-Stack**
Elastic Stack configurations for centralized log ingestion, parsing, and cross-platform security monitoring.

### Security Tooling (Python)

**Endpoint-monitoring-tools**
Host telemetry scripts covering disk, memory, load, and service monitoring.

**Defensive-security-tools**
Defensive utilities supporting blue-team analysis and experimentation.

**Network-security-labs**
Lab-based network security scenarios focused on attack simulation, traffic inspection, and detection techniques.

### Browser Extensions (OSINT & Investigation)

**ShodanLookup**
**VirusTotal-Lookup**
**AbuseIPDBCheck**
**Windows-Security-Event-Log-lookup**

Lightweight browser tooling designed to streamline IOC validation, infrastructure intelligence, and investigation workflows.

## Focus Areas

* Endpoint telemetry and SIEM pipelines
* Detection engineering fundamentals
* Python and JavaScript security tooling
* Network traffic analysis and security monitoring
